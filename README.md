# [Gardener Extension for CoreOS Container Linux](https://gardener.cloud)

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-os-coreos)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-os-coreos)

Project Gardener implements the automated management and operation of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters as a service. Its main principle is to leverage Kubernetes concepts for all of its tasks.

Recently, most of the vendor specific logic has been developed [in-tree](https://github.com/gardener/gardener). However, the project has grown to a size where it is very hard to extend, maintain, and test. With [GEP-1](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/01-extensibility.md) we have proposed how the architecture can be changed in a way to support external controllers that contain their very own vendor specifics. This way, we can keep Gardener core clean and independent.

This controller operates on the `OperatingSystemConfig` resource in the `extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1` API group. It manages those objects that are requesting [CoreOS container linux](https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/) configuration (`.spec.type=coreos`):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: OperatingSystemConfig
metadata:
  name: pool-01-original
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: coreos
  units:
    ...
  files:
    ...
```

Please find [a concrete example](example/operatingsystemconfig.yaml) in the `example` folder.

After reconciliation the resulting data will be stored in a secret within the same namespace (as the config itself might contain confidential data). The name of the secret will be written into the resource's `.status` field:

```yaml
...
status:
  ...
  cloudConfig:
    secretRef:
      name: osc-result-pool-01-original
      namespace: default
```

The secret has one data key `cloud_config` that stores the generation.

An example for a `ControllerRegistration` resource that can be used to register this controller to Gardener can be found [here](example/controllerregistration-os-coreos.yaml).

Please find more information regarding the extensibility concepts and a detailed proposal [here](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/01-extensibility.md).

:warning: Be aware that this repository contains packages and functions that might be moved to another repository for better re-usability soon.

## To start using or developing this extension controller locally

You can run the controller locally on your machine by executing `make start`. Please make sure to have the kubeconfig to the cluster you want to connect to ready in the `./dev/kubeconfig` file.

Static code checks and tests can be executed by running `make verify`. We are using [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for Golang package dependency management and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)/[Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) for testing.
